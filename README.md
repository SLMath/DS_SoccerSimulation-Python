## Description
Based on the groups for Soccer Olimpic Games in 2020, it is made an analysis on the possible results.

It is estimated a poisson distribuiton for the number of goals each team makes in a match, despite of its opponent.

Given this statistics, matches are simulated we can infer the outcome for the cup.

The ideia is to simulate the cup many times so we can extract some statistics for it.
